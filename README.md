## How It Works

With My Board Game Cafe, you have access to an extensive collection of board games that you can browse. Our collection includes a wide range of board games, from classic favorites like Monopoly and Risk to modern hits like Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride. We also have lesser-known games from around the world that you may not have heard of before. You can browse by the Top Picks or by number of players you would like to play with. Links to where you can purchase the games are also provided.
